# Physics Lab Analysis

Python scripts for data analysis in undergraduate physics experiments.

## Requirements for running `lab.py`
- Python 3.10 or later versions
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- openpyxl (needed by Pandas to read `.xlsx` files)

## Workflow

1. Fill in each lab's `data.xlsx` (and `data2.xlsx`, etc., if a lab has more than one) with measurements. Column meanings are documented per lab below.
2. Run that lab's `lab.py`. It can be run from anywhere. The current working directory doesn't matter.
3. `lab.py` reads the spreadsheet(s), recomputes every derived quantity, then:
   - clears and rewrites a single `report.tex` per lab with all LaTeX table fragments (so reruns are idempotent, not appended);
   - regenerates every figure into `figures/`, overwriting the old ones.

### Details

1. `BASE_DIR` is derived from the script's own location (`Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent`)
2. Shared helpers (`pm`, `percent`, `df_to_latex`, `typeA_uncertainty`, `linear_model`, `compute_r_squared`) live in the root-level `package.py` and are imported by every `lab.py` via `sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).resolve().parent.parent))`.

## How to use `report.tex`?

It only contains LaTeX tables, and direct compilation will not produce any results.

The recommended approach is to import the images from `figures/` and `report.tex` together into `latexplate.tex`, and then compile it locally or on Overleaf. You should then get a PDF file.

Of course, you can also use your preferred preamble to format the document, but you must include the following three LaTeX packages: `booktabs`, `siunitx`, and `xeCJK`.

## data.xlsx reference

### Lab 3 — Centripetal force

`data.xlsx` has one sheet per experiment, each storing raw (ungrouped) period readings.

**Sheet `Exp1`**

| Column | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `m_g` | g | Hanging mass as a equivalent of centripetal force, varied across rows; multiple raw rows per mass |
| `T_s` | s | Raw measured period of rotation |

**Sheet `Exp2`**

| Column | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `r_cm` | cm | Rotation radius, varied across rows; multiple raw rows per radius |
| `T_s` | s | Raw measured period of rotation |

**Experiments**

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Exp1 | $M$ and $r$ fixed, hanging mass $m$ varied — infer $m$ from each measured period ($mg=4\pi^2Mr/T^2$), then fit $T^{-2}$ vs. $m$ to estimate $M$ from the slope |
| Exp2 | $M$ and $m$ fixed, rotation radius $r$ varied — fit $T^2$ vs. $r$ to estimate $m$ from the slope; cross-checked by substituting Exp2's period at the radius matching Exp1's fixed $r$ into Exp1's $T^{-2}$–$m$ fit line |

**Constants** (hardcoded in `lab.py`)

| Line | Variable | Value | Unit | Used in | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 14 | `g` | 9.8 | m/s² | both | Standard gravity |
| 15 | `M_ref` | 209.2e-3 | kg | both | Rotating-body mass (balance reading), fixed in both experiments |
| 16 | `r1` | 0.1200 | m | both | Rotation radius fixed in Experiment 1; also the radius in Experiment 2 used for the cross-check |
| 17 | `m_ref` | 55.34e-3 | kg | Exp2 | Hanging-mass balance reading, fixed in Experiment 2 |
| 23 | `T_TYPEB_S` | $0.010/\sqrt{12}$ | s | both | Type-B uncertainty of $T$ from the 10 ms stopwatch resolution, combined with the Type-A (std/√N) uncertainty per mass/radius group |.

### Lab 5 — Moments of inertia

`data.xlsx` has three sheets.

**Sheet `part1_3_timestamps`**

Each column is one f-t regression's raw stopwatch-reading chain (ascending, ms). Consecutive entries form a $(T_1,T_2)$ pair (`T1=chain[:-1]`, `T2=chain[1:]`).

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `hori_loaded`, `hori_friction` | Part 1, horizontal disk — loaded and friction (unloaded) runs |
| `verti_loaded`, `verti_friction` | Part 2, vertical disk |
| `d10_loaded`/`_friction` … `d14_loaded`/`_friction` | Part 3, off-axis disk at each `d` condition |
| `platform_loaded`, `platform_friction` | Part 3, rotating platform + counterweight only (no disk) |

**Sheet `part1_3_conditions`** (indexed by `group`, matching the column-name prefixes above)

| Column | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `group` | – | Condition identifier — matches the timestamp-column prefix; only used as labels/lookup keys, **the values 10,11,...,14 itself carry no meaning**. You shouldn't change anything in this column. |
| `mass_g` | g | Hanging mass for this condition's f-t fit. |
| `d_cm` | cm | Disk offset distance (Part 3 only; NaN for `hori`/`verti`/`platform`) — drives both the parallel-axis-theorem calculation and the table/figure caption text, so **changing it here is sufficient**, no code edit needed |

**Sheet `part4_raw`**

| Column | Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `config` | – | `disk` (calibration disk with known $I$) / `hole1` / `hole2` / `hole3` (black-box suspension holes) |
| `T1_s`, `T2_s` | s | Start/end stopwatch reading; $30T=T_2-T_1$ |

**Parts**

| Part | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1 | Horizontal disk about its central axis — $I_{\text{obs}}$ vs. $I_{\text{ref}}=MR^2/2$ |
| 2 | Vertical disk about its diameter axis — $I_{\text{obs}}$ vs. $I_{\text{ref}}=MR^2/4+ML^2/12$ |
| 3 | Parallel axis theorem — off-axis disk at five $d$ values plus a no-disk platform baseline; $I_{\text{off}}$ vs. $d^2$ regression compared against the disk+adapter mass (slope) and $I_{\text{hori,ref}}$ (intercept $-\,I_{\text{plat}}$) |
| 4 | Torsion pendulum ($T=2\pi\sqrt{I/\kappa}$) — calibrate $\kappa$ from a disk of known $I$, then solve for the unknown black box's $I_{xx}$, $I_{yy}$, $I_{zz}$ |

First theree parts use $\alpha,\alpha_f=2\pi s$, the slopes of weighted f-t linear fits ($f=0.1/(T_2-T_1)$, $t=(T_1+T_2)/2$, loaded run gives $\alpha$, friction/unloaded run gives $\alpha_f$), fed into $I=\dfrac{mr(g-r\alpha)}{\alpha-\alpha_f}$.

| 19 | `R_disk` | 0.1142 | m | Parts 1–3 | Disk radius (2R = 22.84 cm) |
| 20 | `L_disk` | 0.0254 | m | Part 2 | Disk thickness |
| 28 | `mass_ref_kg` | 1.4757 | kg | Part 3 | Disk + adapter mass (weighed together, not separately) — compared against the $I_{\text{off}}$–$d^2$ fit's slope |
| 30 | `T_TYPEB_MS` | $1/\sqrt{12}$ | ms | Parts 1–3 | Type-B uncertainty of each raw stopwatch reading $T_1$/$T_2$  (1 ms resolution), propagated into each f-t data point's uncertainty before fitting |
| 33 | `M_ref4` | 0.6606 | kg | Part 4 | Calibration disk mass |
| 34 | `R_ref4` | 0.06015 | m | Part 4 | Calibration disk radius (2R = 120.30 mm) |
